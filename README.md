# M02Lab---Case-Study
Write a Python app that will accept student names and GPAs and test if the student qualifies for either the Dean's List or the Honor Roll. Your app will:

ask for and accept a student's last name.

quit processing student records if the last name entered is 'ZZZ'.

ask for and accept a student's first name.

ask for and accept the student's GPA as a float.

test if the student's GPA is 3.5 or greater and, if so, print a message saying that the student has made the Dean's List.

test if the student's GPA is 3.25 or greater and, if so, print a message saying that the studnet has made the Honor Roll.
